                    <p>I’m Ojugo Silas, a full-stack web developer who loves building clean, functional, and scalable apps.
                        When I’m not buried in React or Express, I’m deep in basketball debates reminding everyone that Bill
                        Russell is the real GOAT. My playlist? A weird mix of old-school tracks that somehow make debugging
                        feel like jazz.</p>

                    <h3>Areas of Low Confidence</h3>
                    <p>
                        I’m working to strengthen my understanding of design patterns and data structures & algorithms. While I
                        can build functional backend systems, I want to improve how I apply efficient algorithms and structured
                        design principles to write cleaner, scalable code.

                    <p>
                        Dear future me,
                        Remember how eager you were to grow during HNG13 — to write cleaner code, collaborate better, and not
                        just build things that work, but things that last. Keep that energy alive. Don’t be afraid to break
                        things, ask questions, or admit when you’re stuck; that’s where the learning happens.
                        Also, take pride in how far you’ve come — from debugging late at night to now building solutions that
                        people actually use. Stay curious, stay humble, and never forget why you started: to create, to learn,
                        and to make an impact through tech.
                    </p>

            <h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                I see the HNG13 Internship as more than just a training program — it’s a chance to test my discipline,
                teamwork, and creativity under real-world pressure.
                I want to learn from mentors, share knowledge with peers, and leave with not just better code, but
                better habits.
